****TEXT CLASSIFIER****

The goal of text classification is to categorize text documents into different classes. This is an extremely
important analysis technique in NLP. We will use a technique, which is based on a statistic called tf-idf,
which stands for term frequencyâ€”inverse document frequency. This is an analysis tool that helps us
understand how important a word is to a document in a set of documents. This serves as a feature vector
that's used to categorize documents.
